00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.880
so crew doesn't have to actually place a&nbsp;
camera the ground can just fly up the crew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.720
can take all of the Selfies that they want&nbsp;
that's right yeah there's actually there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.514
a touchcreen on the front also so that crew&nbsp;
can also interact with the robot oh cool

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.297
(Maria)
So, crew doesn't have 
to actually place&nbsp;a camera.

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:25.546
The ground controllers can just fly up--

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.638
(Host #1)
So the crew can take all of the selfies that they&nbsp;want?

00:00:27.638 --> 00:00:28.582
[Laughter] 
[Crosstalk]

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:30.611
(Host #2)
That's actually the goal here,
I think

00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:32.646
(Maria)
There is a touch screen 
on the front also

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:34.772
so that crew can also interact 
with the robot.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.000
(Host #2)
Oh cool!
