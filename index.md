## Who is this guide for?
This guide is designed for people new to providing closed captions on video. This guide will help you make your media accessible, even if you don't have the budget for professional captioning or transcription. While there are multiple approaches to captioning video, this method walks you through editing the free, autogenerated captions provided by a video hosting platform.

## About auto-generated captions
Auto-generated captions, also known as automatic captions or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) captions, use machine learning to turn audio into written text. These captions can be highly accurate. However, they need a human editor to fix mistakes and add elements like speaker names or sound effects to the captions for full accessibility. 

### When to add
When producing a video, build in time towards the end of your project for editing captions. Be sure that you've made all needed edits to your media, then upload it to your video hosting platform of choice (for example, YouTube). If you edit your captions, and then need to change your media, you will have to start over. Your video platform will take some time to generate captions. Once complete, you can edit them as a final step before publishing.

### Platform-specific resources
This guide is intended to help you know what to edit and add to auto-generated captions, regardless of the platform you use. For details on how to find and edit auto-generated captions on a specific platform, visit the following resources.

## Proofreading
### Punctuation
Depending on the platform used, the auto-generated captions may or may not have punctuation added. Captions should be punctuated to promote readability and understanding. If your captions do not have punctuation, add it as you edit. If your captions have punctuation, make sure that the placement is correct. Occasionally, the caption generator will misinterpret pauses and add punctuation that does not reflect the message being communicated.

As humans do not always speak in fully formed, gramatically correct sentences, use your best judgement. In general, simple punctuation and multiple shorter sentences are better. Remember, only a portion of the sentence will appear on screen at a time, so use parenthesis and semi-colons sparingly. Your edits should support understanding, not distract.

### Spelling
Check the spelling of words and that the auto-generated captions have the correct word. Some caption editors will have spellcheck built in.
#### Common errors
Watch for these common errors in your captions.
- Names: Your captions may spell names incorrectly, or mistake them for other words. Always check names of people, places, and organizations/companies to confirm they are spelled correctly.
- Technical/scientific words: If your media uses technical or specialized language, the caption generator may mistake these terms for more common words. If you are not certain how to spell a term, search for the term or consult a subject matter expert.
- Homonyms: Autogenerated captions may mix up words that sound the same but have different spelling or meanings. For example, 'accept' and 'except' or 'soar' and 'sore'. 

#### Tip: Search for repeated mistakes
If you notice that a mistake is repeated, many caption editors have a find and replace function. For example, if a name appears mispelled the same way throughout captions, you can use Find or Find and Replace to quickly identify and edit all similar mistakes.

#### What if you can't tell what a word/sound is?
Sometimes the audio quality or background noises make it difficult to tell what was said. Make a best effort to figure out what the missing word is, and consult a second person. If the word is still not identified, type `[INAUDIBLE]`.
