00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.338
(Jonny Kim)
And my favorite quote when I think
about purpose-driven service 

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:08.130
is from the late&nbsp;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
who said that,&nbsp;

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.560
"Everyone has the power for greatness. 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.859
"Not for fame, but greatness,

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.097
"because greatness 
is&nbsp;determined by service."

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:19.391
And I love this quote 
because Dr. King got it right.

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:24.485
Is that&nbsp;our lives are fulfilled, 
and the lives of the people we love

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:29.000
are fulfilled&nbsp;when we have 
a purpose-driven life.
