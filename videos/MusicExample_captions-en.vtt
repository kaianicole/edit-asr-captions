(Florence Tan)
To commemorate SAM's birthday 
and Curiosity's&nbsp;birthday on Mars,

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:06.054
we decided to play a little song.

00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:11.000
If there's anyone listening on Mars&nbsp;
on this special occasion,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you will hear this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:34.353

It's really neat, 
and it's exciting.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.300
This is a first for NASA, 
and for the world.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.229
And music&nbsp;brings us all together, 
so this is fun.
