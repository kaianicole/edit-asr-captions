00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.000
[Dr. Straughn]
That whole process of galaxies 
forming and&nbsp;evolving over 13+ billion years,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.632
we've learned a lot about that, 
but we're really&nbsp;missing 

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.864
a key piece of the puzzle,
which is how galaxies got their start.

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:14.332
So that's the piece&nbsp;that we haven't seen yet, 
and that's the piece 

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:18.339
the James Webb Space Telescope 
will allow us to see for&nbsp;the very first time.

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.097
[Dr. Mather]
So the first stars in galaxies
are really the big mystery for us.

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:23.542
We don't know&nbsp;how that happened.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.000
We don't know when it happened.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.104
We have a pretty good idea that 
they were very&nbsp;much larger than the Sun,

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:30.864
and that they would burn out 
in a tremendous burst of glory

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.364
in just a few&nbsp;million years, 
which is really very short.

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.339
But, they&nbsp;would also prepare the way 
for further generations&nbsp;of stars

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:37.833
like the Sun to be formed.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.225
So those first stars would produce 
the chemical elements of&nbsp;life,

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:45.034
carbon and oxygen and nitrogen 
and iron and sulfur and calcium

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:46.308
and all the things that
we're made of,

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:49.356
would have been produced 
in those first generations of stars

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:52.529
that then explode&nbsp;and liberate 
their material back out into space.

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:56.071
So, the next generation of stars 
could form with&nbsp;planets,

00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:05.920
with solid bodies, 
and possibly have life.
