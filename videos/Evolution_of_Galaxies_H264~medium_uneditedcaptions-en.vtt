uh<00:00:05.200><c> we've</c><00:00:05.359><c> learned</c><00:00:05.600><c> a</c><00:00:05.720><c> lot</c><00:00:05.920><c> about</c><00:00:06.200><c> that</c><00:00:06.359><c> but</c>

uh we've learned a lot about that but
we're<00:00:06.799><c> really</c><00:00:07.120><c> missing</c><00:00:07.520><c> a</c><00:00:07.720><c> key</c><00:00:08.120><c> piece</c><00:00:08.280><c> of</c><00:00:08.400><c> the</c>

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
we're really missing a key piece of the
 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.629 align:start position:0%
we're really missing a key piece of the

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
start so that's the piece that we
 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
start so that's the piece that we

happened we have a pretty good idea that
 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
happened we have a pretty good idea that

they were very much larger than the Sun

and that they would burn out in a
