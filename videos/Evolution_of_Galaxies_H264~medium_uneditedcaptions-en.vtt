00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.360
that whole process of galaxies forming and&nbsp;
evolving over 13 plus billion years uh we've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.640
learned a lot about that but we're really&nbsp;
missing a key piece of the puzzle which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.400
how galaxies got their start so that's the piece&nbsp;
that we haven't seen yet and that's the piece the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.480
James web Space Telescope will allow us to see for&nbsp;
the very first time so the first stars in galaxies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.120
are really the big mystery for us we don't know&nbsp;
how that happened we don't know when it happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.080
we have a pretty good idea that they were very&nbsp;
much larger than the Sun and that they would burn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.760
out in a tremendous burst of Glory in just a few&nbsp;
million years which is really very short but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.880
would also prepare the way for further generations&nbsp;
of stars like the sun to be formed so those first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.400
Stars would produce the chemical elements of&nbsp;
Life carbon and oxygen and nitrogen and iron&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.880
and sulfur and calcium and all the things that&nbsp;
were made of would have been produced in those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.520
first generations of stars that then explode&nbsp;
and Liberate the material back out into space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.920
so the next generation of stars could form with&nbsp;
planets with solid bodies and possibly have life
